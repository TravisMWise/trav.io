                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>Qualifications</h2>
                <p>
                &emsp; Recent college graduate from the University of Central Florida (UCF) in December of 2022 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Graduated with a 3.85 UCF specific grade point average (GPA) and an overall GPA of 3.77 between UCF and my other college credits at Daytona State College (DSC) and Seminole State College (SSC) where I achieved my Associate of Arts degree in the summer of 2020.
                </p>
                <h2>Pre-College</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Before I came back to college in 2018, I had taken 4 years off of education. I graduated high school in 2014 from Deland High and never expected to go to college at any point in my life. I did however have a very successful time in high school with being apart of the engineering program for 3 of the 4 years and did dual enrollment in my fourth year taking most of my classes at Daytona State. Nevertheless, I decided to continue working the job I had at the time which was an entry level job at Publix Supermarkets and then move on to a higher paying job at Command Medical Products working as an extrusion operator making high quality medical tubing. After three years at Publix and four years at Command I realized that that type of job was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I looked inward to see what I would enjoy and what I have passion in. After researching and trying new things for months I decided to go back to school and go into Computer Science. I have always enjoyed math and the little bit of coding I had done in the past came easily and was fun, not to mention the field is growing and has lots of potential.
                </p>
                <h2>During College</h2>
                <h3>Early College</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Throughout my college life I realized how fun learning can be and I found myself digging into textbooks weeks or months before the classes even started. Picking up new languages and frameworks opens up hundreds if not thousands of possibilities with each new element I add to my repertoire. It seems like every week I am learning more and more about the field, and I cannot wait for five or 10 years from now to see know much more I know and how much more I can do with that knowledge.
                </p>
                <h3>Higher Level Classes</h3>
                <p>&emsp; I took the following classes as my six electives for my degree, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, ROBOT VISION, COMPUTER GRAPHICS, PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES I, CONCEPTS PARALLEL DISTRIBUTED, and DATABASE SYSTEMS. </p>
                <p>&emsp; Of all the classes I took for my electives Database Systems and Robot Vision are the classes I liked the most. Both classes left me with a feeling that I can use the knowledge in real world problems, which is something I felt is lacking in many of the other classes I took at UCF.	</p>
                <h3>Senior Design</h3>
                <p>&emsp; Senior Design was a full year for me and my other four group members, we chose to do Spring-Fall and skip the summer so we could all do internships over the summer. We chose to do a self-sponsorship project for the class so we would have the freedom to do whatever we wanted and not be locked into a project we did not like and did not want to do. After a few meetings about what we wanted to do and a few project ideas later we decided to create a game. Throughout the year of development this idea went through many variations and finally became a game engine, a level editor, and a game all in one project and all made from scratch using pure JavaScript and the p5 library which was only used to load images for rendering. </p>
                <p>&emsp; The engine and level editor can be reused and extracted from the game for reuse as needed, but we had a major flaw that we could not fix by the end of our senior design class. Namely, we had an issue with loading that took us months of working with and trying to debug that never fully got solved, although we did reduce the problem dramatically. In the end the strength of the computer running the game determined how much we were able to load into the game at any point, this dramatically limited the scope of the game and the number of enemies we were able to add to the game and we had to scrap most of the work we put into the AI's simply because we could not load them all. I have a demo of the game on this website here, where you can explore the game without the enemies to ensure anyone can play the game and explore the game's graphics and map since this was a major part of my contribution to the project.</p>
                <p>&emsp; Even though we had our issues with the project, we all learned a lot about game development and creating a major project with multiple contributors. Personally I found that I really enjoy making games and would like to spend more time making more serious games using more powerful tools such as Unity and Unreal.</p>
                <h3>Internship</h3>
                <p>&emsp; I worked at Applied Research Associates (ARA) in the Virtual Heroes Division as a Software Engineering Intern from February 2022 to November 2022. As stated above, the plan was to work an internship over the summer, but I was able to get in early and stay a bit later than expected. This was nice because I was able to get more experience and learn more about the industry, but this was very difficult for me to maintain school life with my higher-level class and an internship, not to mention working my project in senior design. </p>
                <p>&emsp; Nevertheless, I did learn much about the industry during the internship. I worked on the frontend and backend in various projects mainly using Go, Python, and Angular. Each of which I had vary little experience with before the internship. Using Go I mainly working on creating concurrent programs to speed up programs made using python which resulted in significant speedups of 50-70%. I used python in the backend to send, receive, and modify information for the frontend of applications. Then by far my favorite part of the internship was using Angular to create, modify, and debug applications.</p>
                <p>&emsp; I did, however, have many things I did not like about this internship which eventually led me to faze out of working at ARA. By far my biggest issue was that since they were contracted for work I never knew what I would be working on the next day. At any point in the day/project I could be told that I am being switched to a new project and each project was something I had never worked on before meaning I needed to drop everything and then do hours of research on a new topic that I had no experience with. These switches meant that I spent most of my time just learning/reading about technology instead of actually creating anything and since I was focusing mostly on school and working part time it was very hard to get things done at the internship. Another issue was the work environment, namely, the people working there did not seem to care about the company and I felt like I was back at Command Medical Products which left me with a bad feeling. Finally, I did not realize that they were government contracted before I started working there and I was working on projects for the military that I was not comfortable with (which I cannot discuss because of an NDA). All of these together and more made me know that the job was not something I wanted to do in the future and helped me learn a lot about what I did want for my future.</p>
                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In the future, I want to find a job that is more in line with what I enjoy doing and more consistent than the work I found at ARA. I would like to continue learning more about game development and create games that I and other enjoy playing. Looking back at when I was a kid playing games online I want to strive to make that environment for kids and adults today. Along with game development I want to dive into artificial intelligence and computer vision more. I got a good taste of them in my classes at UCF, but I know that we only scratched the surface and they pair very well with game development especially with making in game enemies and creating game graphics.
