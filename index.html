              &emsp;I have experience making many games and making games is my current passion in the computer science field. 
              From using JavaScript and WebGL to create games from scratch or using powerful engines such as Unity and Unreal engine or 
              even designing and creating my own engine in JavaScript.
              <br>&emsp; When I was younger I always enjoyed creating things and played many games that allowed the user to create their own world and play
              in that world. This may be why I found a passion for game development. I have learned a great deal about developing games and I plan to 
              continue making games for a long time.

              &emsp;I have experience creating a few different websites for school and personal projects. 
              I also have experience working on small parts of websites during my time working as a software engineering intern at ARA. 
              <br>&emsp;Languages/Tools I know, like to use and are fluent with are HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Angular, PHP, and MySQL. 
              I am also familiar with stacks such as MongoDB-Express-React-Node (MERN) and MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node (MEAN) although 
              I prefer using a sequel database and try to avoid using node unless the project need it.

            <p class="card-text">
              &emsp; I enjoy solving problems and learning how things work. I have always liked working on problems and puzzles and my time 
              learning Computer Science has amplified this by introducing me to algorithm and problem solving on a massive scale.
              <br> &emsp; I am fascinated by many of the complex problems in computer science and the one that peaked my interest the most is 
              P versus NP. In the future I hope to go back to college and get my Masters and or PHD and do some real research in the field.

              Pickleball is a very fun sport and is about what you would get is you put together Tennis and Ping Pong. 
              The game is designed to be a bit slower than Tennis but still have a good amount of speed. 
              You can play anywhere from 2 to 4 players in a game and it's a very fun and social game while also being 
              fairly competitive at high end play.

              Racquetball has always been one of my favorite sports and I love going on the court and hitting perfect corner shots.
              The game is extremely fun and a great workout. It is similar to taking Tennis but putting the players on one 
              side of the net and inside a big box.

              Cycling became my go to activity for exercise and adventure right when I picked it up. I can ride for 10 to 40 or 
              even 50 miles at a time and you can never beat the feeling of riding down a new trail and exploring all that you can.
              I hope to live somewhere that I can easily cycle into work or into town and have enough biking lanes to be comfortable riding down the street.

            <p class="card-text">
              I picked up chess in my first or second year of college and started playing online. I had some experience when I was younger but never worked on the game.
              I started at around 700 rating and climbed rating in my free time, and I am now sitting around 1700-1900 rating and I still play almost every day/week when I can.
              Chess not only is fun and engaging for me but a great way to help me learn to train my brain to better focus and work on solving problems as well as how to 
              not give up when things get difficult.

              Ever since I was younger video games has always been a staple of my life and something I really enjoy. From Halo 2/3 on the Xbox to Elden Ring and Hollow Knight on PC,
              games have and will be something I enjoy. I hope to bring this into my skills as a computer scientist and use my enjoyment of playing games as full to make games 
              that not only I enjoy and love to play but also that others will enjoy as well.
