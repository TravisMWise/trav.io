                <h1>Small Autobiography </h1>
                <h2>Pre-College</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; I was born in Volusia County Florida, April 6th, 1996. I went to Sunrise Elementary, Heritage Middle School, 
                    and DeLand High School. I graduated from DeLand High in May of 2014 where I was dual enrolled at Daytona State 
                    College taking general education classes. At this point in my life I never really cared about the future, I had 
                    no hope or dreams. School was nothing but something I had to do and all I cared to do was the bare minimum, which 
                    is what I did. After graduation I had no plans to continue college and because of this I did not continue going. 
                    I took 4 years off school, which I do not regret to this day.
                    <br><br>&emsp; During my time off I work at Publix Super Markets (2013 - 2016) and Command Medical Products (2015 - 2019). 
                    After I started working at Command, which I was working at both Publix and Command and will be for another year, I started 
                    earning enough money to move out and get my own place. So I did just that. My girlfriend at the time and I got a place 
                    together and we lived together for another three years. The whole time I was working hard to move up in the company and 
                    got promotion after promotion at Command and eventually I was making enough where I did not need Publix anymore, so I left. 
                    Promotion after promotion, raise after raise I ended up as an Extrusion Operator at Command (which is not a job I find easy 
                    to explain to anyone no mater how much I try). While being in this current position I felt like I had everything I wanted. 
                    I had the pay that I wanted ever since I left high school. I had the girl that I wanted since high school. I had flexibility 
                    in my schedule. I even had some say in the company and control of my environment. But for some reason which I couldn't tell 
                    I was miserable. I would dread waking up in the mornings, I would spend my whole day at work hating it, just waiting till 
                    the time I could go home. I knew that I could not live this forever. I know now that even though I had what I thought I 
                    wanted, that was not what I really want. I know this because up until this point I had never even considered what I wanted 
                    out of life. I had never dreamed about the future, or wished for something to happen. I was just living one day at a time 
                    not caring about the next.

                <h2>Wake Up Call</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Time to leave Command and take charge of my life. 
                    <br><br>&emsp; But what do I want to do? 
                    <br><br>&emsp; What do I enjoy?
                    <br><br>&emsp; What am I passionate about?
                    <br><br>&emsp; What would make me happy to wake up to everyday?
                    <br><br>&emsp; What would make life feel meaningful again?
                </p>
                <h2>Decision Time</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; After exploring many options including the Air Force, College, and a few others, I decided I was going to go back to 
                    college and finish my degree. I remembered when I tried out programming in Java a while back and decided to look into getting 
                    a Computer Science degree. While looking into the field I found that this was something I could really get into and enjoy. 
                    The idea of being able to type words into a computer and make anything you want to come to life was mesmerizing to me. That 
                    feeling is still with me to this day. I love that we can come up with some idea and just sit down at the computer and make 
                    the idea a reality and I do not think that will ever go away.
                </p>
                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Going back to college! I signed up for classes at Seminole State College for Summer 2019. I had to relearn most of 
                    what I learned in High School not only because I had been a while but because I never really care about learning back then. 
                    I had to start out with College Algebra, and I could barely remember anything about it from school, so I decided to get a 
                    book on the subject. Before class I went though every topic taught in class and learned it the best I could. Then when 
                    class started I knew the subject so well I was teaching the other students in class when they didn't understand the subject. 
                    I found I was on to something. If I read the book before class I can not only have an easier time in the class but understand 
                    the material better and pass the class with a near 100%. So I kept doing this. Trigonometry, Pre-calculus, Calculus 1, and Calculus 2, 
                    I would get the book early and just read though it on my own time over the break. And every class I learned the material so well 
                    I was even correcting the teachers on their methods and errors.
                    <br><br>&emsp; During this time I realized how fun it is to learn about new subjects. Currently I find that I enjoy learning 
                    about new coding languages and frameworks. It seems like every week I am learning more and more about the field of Computer Science, 
                    and I've never been so hopeful for the future and what will come from it. Now studying Computer Science at the University of Central 
                    Florida, I am eager for the future and excited to see what I can do with all I have learned and have yet to learn. 
                </p>
                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; For my future life as a computer scientist, I want to become a lifelong learner. I want to get my master's and doctorate's 
                    in Computer Science and be everything I never even thought was possible. After I've gotten my doctorate I want to teach Computer 
                    Science and be the teacher that I've looked up to while I've been in school and do for the students of that time what my teachers 
                    have done for me.
                </p>
