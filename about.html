                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>Qualifications</h2>
                <p>
                &emsp; Recent college graduate from the University of Central Florida (UCF) in December of 2022 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. Graduated with a 3.85 UCF specific grade point average (GPA) and an overall GPA of 3.77 between UCF and my other college credits at Daytona State College (DSC) and Seminole State College (SSC) where I achieved my Associate of Arts degree in the summer of 2020.
                </p>
                <h2>Pre-College</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Before I came back to college in 2018, I had taken 4 years off of education. I graduated high school in 2014 from Deland High and never expected to go to college at any point in my life. I did however have a very successful time in high school with being apart of the engineering program for 3 of the 4 years and did dual enrollment in my fourth year taking most of my classes at Daytona State. Nevertheless, I decided to continue working the job I had at the time which was an entry level job at Publix Supermarkets and then move on to a higher paying job at Command Medical Products working as an extrusion operator making high quality medical tubing. After three years at Publix and four years at Command I realized that that type of job was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I looked inward to see what I would enjoy and what I have passion in. After researching and trying new things for months I decided to go back to school and go into Computer Science. I have always enjoyed math and the little bit of coding I had done in the past came easily and was fun, not to mention the field is growing and has lots of potential.

                <h2>During College</h2>
                <h3>Early College</h3>
                <p>
                    &emsp; Throughout my college life I realized how fun learning can be and I found myself digging into textbooks weeks or months before the classes even started. Picking up new languages and frameworks opens up hundreds if not thousands of possibilities with each new element I add to my repertoire. It seems like every week I am learning more and more about the field, and I cannot wait for five or 10 years from now to see know much more I know and how much more I can do with that knowledge.
                </p>
                <h3>Higher Level Classes</h3>
                <h3>Senior Design</h3>
                <h3>Internship</h3>
                <h2>Future</h2>
                <p>
                    &emsp; In the future, I am hoping to dig more into game development. Looking back at when I was a kid playing games online I want to strive to make that environment for kids and adults today. Along with game development I want to dive into artificial intelligence and computer vision more. I got a good taste of them in my classes at UCF but I know that we only scratched the surface and they pair very well with game development especially with making in game AI's and creating graphics for games.
