            &emsp; Before reading further, I have removed a lot of the smaller
            projects from this section that I feel are too simple when compared
            to the more complex applications I have worked on since I first made
            this website. This is because when I work on a project for months at
            a time with multiple team members that project will look far better
            than any small individual project I produce. As a result there is
            far less projects in this list but the ones that are have taken at
            least a few months to a year of time and effort. As I continue my
            career I hope to add a great many projects which I am proud of. Many
            projects small and large and can be seen in the games section of
            this website
            <a href="./games.html">here</a>. Which I plan to add to with each
            new game I create.

            <!-- Description of the project -->
            This application was made as a final project for my Database Systems
            Class to show our knowledge of using MySQL which we gained
            throughout the course. This is the largest and most complex website
            application I have made to this date and uses Windows, Apache,
            MySQL, and PHP. We use functional PHP, prepared statements and
            encrypts and decrypts information when necessary when interacting
            with the database.

            <br /><br />
            &emsp;In the application image below we can see the
            Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) which demonstrates the complexity
            of the database and how all the entities are related. A full 25 page
            description of the project report can be found
            <a

              >here</a
            >. But in short, we created an application to model students being
            able to sign up for universities, join and create Registered Student
            Organizations (RSOs), as well as create and join events which could
            be public, private (meaning only students at the university could
            join), or RSO (meaning only students in the RSO could join). On top
            of these requirements we also created a live chatroom to talk to
            other users on the website and a profile section to update the users
            profile to change their associated information and preferences on
            the website including their name, password, and even light and dark
            mode (which we simply swapped out the CSS files based on their
            preferences).

            <!-- Plans for the future -->
            This application was a way for me to learn more about PHP and MySQL
            and I thoroughly enjoyed the process. I plan to use PHP and MySQL
            much more in the future and I want to use what I learned here to
            create more complex and useful applications when I need them in the
            future. I do not, however, need a complex website with a database
            for anything at this time so I am spending more time focusing on
            learning more about game engines to focus on what I am passionate
            about.

            I created this game while I was taking Computer Science 2, the
            majority of making the game was following a Udemy tutorial called
            <a

            >
            and the main purpose was to learn and make something with C++.
            Although I enjoyed making the game and the development process I do
            not see myself making more in the future. I am currently interested
            in making desktop and website applications. <br />
