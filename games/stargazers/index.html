          <h2>How To Play</h2>
          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;This game is a simple asteroids like game which the player
            controls a space ship and can fly through space destroying
            asteroids. This game was made using only JavaScript and if you would
            like to recreate the game yourself or learn how it was created you
            can read this book here.
            <br /><br />
            &emsp;Controlling the ship is quite difficult and takes some time to
            master since the game uses forces to accelerate the ship and
            asteroids but since the objects are in space there is no gravity to
            slow the objects down and thus any for applied is a constant force
            until another force is applied (Newton's laws of motion). So
            pressing down the key to turn the ship will cause the ship to turn
            forever until you apply a force in the opposite direction. At first
            this is disorienting and hard to control but with time it becomes
            quite fun to fly around and control the physics of the ship.
          </p>
          <h3>Controls</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Turn Ship: A/Left Arrow and D/Right Arrow Keys</li>
            <li>Accelerate Ship: W/Up Arrow and S/Down Arrow Keys</li>
            <li>Stop Ship: Q Key</li>
            <li>Shoot Projectiles: Space Bar</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Scoring and Winning</h3>
          <p>
            &emsp;You can gain score by breaking apart and destroying asteroids.
            Each level has that number of asteroids associated with it causing
            an increase in difficulty for each level and you must destroy all
            asteroids to advance to the next level. There is no end to the
            levels and this is a high score game which means with each time you
            play you try to beat your highest score achieved.
