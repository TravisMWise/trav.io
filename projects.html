        &emsp; Before reading further, I have removed a lot of the smaller
        projects from this section that I feel are too simple when compared
        to the more complex applications I have worked on since I first made
        this website. This is because when I work on a project for months at
        a time with multiple team members that project will look far better
        than any small individual project I produce. As a result there is
        far less projects in this list but the ones that are have taken at
        least a few months to a year of time and effort. As I continue my
        career I hope to add a great many projects which I am proud of. Many
        projects small and large and can be seen in the games section of
        this website
        <a href="./games.html">here</a>. Which I plan to add to with each
        new game I create.

        <!-- Description of the project -->
        This application was made as a final project for my Database Systems
        Class to show our knowledge of using MySQL which we gained
        throughout the course. This is the largest and most complex website
        application I have made to this date and uses Windows, Apache,
        MySQL, and PHP. We use functional PHP, prepared statements and
        encrypts and decrypts information when necessary when interacting
        with the database.

        <br /><br />
        &emsp;In the application image below we can see the
        Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) which demonstrates the complexity
        of the database and how all the entities are related. A full 25 page
        description of the project report can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/TravisMWise/ClubEventOrganizer/blob/main/ReportInformation/ProjectReport.pdf" >here</a >. 
        But in short, we created an application to model students being
        able to sign up for universities, join and create Registered Student
        Organizations (RSOs), as well as create and join events which could
        be public, private (meaning only students at the university could
        join), or RSO (meaning only students in the RSO could join). On top
        of these requirements we also created a live chatroom to talk to
        other users on the website and a profile section to update the users
        profile to change their associated information and preferences on
        the website including their name, password, and even light and dark
        mode (which we simply swapped out the CSS files based on their
        preferences).

        <!-- Plans for the future -->
        This application was a way for me to learn more about PHP and MySQL
        and I thoroughly enjoyed the process. I plan to use PHP and MySQL
        much more in the future and I want to use what I learned here to
        create more complex and useful applications when I need them in the
        future. I do not, however, need a complex website with a database
        for anything at this time so I am spending more time focusing on
        learning more about game engines to focus on what I am passionate
        about.

      <p class="project-description">
        <br />
        &emsp; Dimension is a game that was made for senior design by my
        team members and I that took over a year to develop. My other team
        members on the project were Kenaniah Subrahmanyam, Isaac
        Subrahmanyam, Jason Dookhoo, and Jenan Abas. We decided to develop
        the game in JavaScript to increase the complexity of the project and
        create everything from scratch only using the p5.js library to
        preload images for the game. This lead us to create a complete game
        engine and a level editor which we discuss in detail
        <a href="./games/dimension/dimensionCDR.html">here</a>
        if you would like to read more and there is a demo video you can
        watch
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vj2GCrb2X6E">here</a>. The
        game engine and level editor are reusable for the creation of future
        projects if we choose to do so but I am focusing more on using more
        powerful engines such as Unity and Unreal.

        &emsp;In the future I want to expand this game, but it is not
        possible using the same tools we used due to the loading issues we
        had with the game. In the future I would like to reuse assets we
        purchased and create a new game with a similar feel and direction
        using Unity and make a fun and entertaining game.
