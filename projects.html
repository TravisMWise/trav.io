            This game was made using free assets for graphics and models. The
            game currently supports health, stamina, dying, re-spawning, item
            pickups (potions/coins/weapons), spawning enemies in random
            locations, AI movement, multiple levels, a pause menu with
            resume/save/load/quit game options.

            <!-- Plans for the future -->
            I created this game while I was taking Computer Science 2, the
            majority of making the game was following a Udemy tutorial called
            <a

              >Unreal Engine C++ the Ultimate Game Developer Course</a
            >
            and the main purpose was to learn and make something with C++.
            Although I enjoyed making the game and the development process I do
            not see myself making more in the future. I am currently interested
            in making desktop and website applications. <br />

            Textio is a text editor with an integrated terminal I developed
            using Electron.js. The application is supported on Windows and Linux
            thanks to the flexibility of Electron.

            The end goal of Textio is to make a Text editor that rivals that of
            Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Notepad++. Although for now, I
            used this project as a way to learn Electron.js. I am very pleased
            with what I learned and eager to learn more when I have the time.
            Electron has been one of my favorite frameworks thus far.

            Computer Graphics class at UCF which is playable here

            The application was made to showcase the topics in computer graphics
            that we learned throughout the semester including model rendering,
            lighting, shadow rendering, sky box rendering, bloom post processing
            and more.

            When making this I did not find MERN to be something I enjoyed and
            the quality of the application reflects that although it works well
            and is fully functioning. I want to go back through this application
            and make it something I can be more proud of and give MERN another
            chance. I plan to add in a login system and make the UI more
            user-friendly.
